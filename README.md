# Backstage Cena — Web Platform for Connecting Musicians

Backstage Cena is a web application created to connect musicians through a centralized platform. The project allows users to register, store information in a relational database, and interact through a structured web system designed to support collaboration and visibility.

This project was developed as part of my learning process in web development and database integration.

## Project overview
Musicians often rely on multiple social networks to promote their work and find collaborators. Backstage Cena was designed as a focused platform where musicians can create profiles and centralize information related to their work, reducing fragmentation and improving accessibility.

The project goes beyond a static website by implementing data persistence using a relational database.

## Objectives
- Provide a platform to connect musicians  
- Allow user registration and persistent data storage  
- Apply relational database concepts using SQL  
- Integrate front-end, back-end, and database layers  

---

## System description
Backstage Cena is structured as a web application with database support and user interaction.

Main components:
- Front-end interface for user interaction  
- Back-end logic for processing requests  
- Relational database for persistent data storage  
- SQL queries for data insertion, retrieval, and updates  

The system focuses on clarity and correctness, prioritizing functional implementation and learning.

## Methodology
1. Definition of the platform concept and use cases  
2. Design of the relational database structure  
3. Implementation of front-end interfaces  
4. Development of back-end logic  
5. SQL integration and functional testing

## Learning outcomes
Through this project, I was able to:
- Design and use relational databases  
- Write SQL queries for data manipulation  
- Understand data persistence in web applications  
- Integrate front-end interfaces with a database  
- Organize a web project structure
